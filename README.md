# Image-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

This repository demonstrates how to build and deploy an image classification model using machine learning. The project involves:

- Preprocessing image datasets.
- Training a machine learning model using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Deploying the model for predictions.

## Features

- **Multi-class image classification**: Predicts the category of an input image from predefined classes.
- **Customizable architecture**: Easily modify or extend the model architecture.
- **Scalable training pipeline**: Works with large datasets.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-ml.git
cd image-classification-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

1. Use a publicly available dataset such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet.
2. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory or specify the path in the script.

## Usage

### Training the Model

Run the following command to start training the model:

```bash
python train.py --dataset_path data/ --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

Parameters:
- `--dataset_path`: Path to the dataset.
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `--batch_size`: Number of samples per training batch.

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model on a test dataset, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path saved_models/model.pth --test_data_path data/test/
```

### Inference

To predict the class of a new image:

```bash
python predict.py --model_path saved_models/model.pth --image_path sample.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch. It can be customized by modifying the `model.py` script.

## Results

| Metric          | Value        |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Accuracy        | 92%          |
| Precision       | 90%          |
| Recall          | 91%          |
